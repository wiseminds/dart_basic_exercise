/// this is a simple task to print the result of BMI calculation
///
/// Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person’s height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person’s weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared.
/// A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.
/// the result should read `You are {height}m tall and you weigh {weight}kg, your BMI is {bmi}`
/// an example is if the user enters 2 as height and 60 as weight  `You are 2m tall and you weigh 60kg, your BMI is 15.0`
///
/// to run code paste `dart basic_arithmetic_operations/bmi_calculator.dart ` in the terminal

void main() {
  

  print('PUT YOUR RESULT HERE');
